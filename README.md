# Formula-1-Point-prediction
### Project Description: 
This data science project explores the fascinating realm of Formula 1 racing through the lens of comprehensive data analysis and visualization. Leveraging Python as the primary tool, we delve into an extensive Formula 1 dataset encompassing race results, driver information, team details, and various performance metrics. The project aims to uncover insights into the factors influencing race outcomes, driver performance, and team dynamics.

### Dataset:
Our dataset is a comprehensive compilation of 14 CSV files, each capturing extensive information about Formula 1 races spanning a significant time frame from 1950 to 2023. These files collectively provide a wealth of key insights, offering a detailed perspective on various aspects of Formula 1 racing.
The dataset encompasses diverse information, including details from trial matches, constructor positions, the location (country) of each race, the total number of laps, the configuration of the racetrack (number of turns), lap times recorded, constructor points accumulated, championship points awarded, the nationality of drivers, pit stop statistics, and the number of victories achieved by each participant.
In essence, these 14 CSV files serve as a rich source of data, allowing for in-depth analysis and exploration of Formula 1 races over the years, covering a wide range of aspects that contribute to the dynamic and competitive nature of this iconic motorsport.
